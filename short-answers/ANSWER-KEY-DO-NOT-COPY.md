Dock a single .5 points if *any* of the questions were so grammatically incorrect it was distracting. "Distracting" meaning that if you saw this on the job, you would have them retype it for clarification. Either because the grammar was so poor you literally didn't understand, or because their were 2 or more blatant spelling mistakes.

There are 3 questions so the total possible points is 6.
